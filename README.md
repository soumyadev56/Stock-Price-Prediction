# Stock Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based stock price prediction model that leverages machine learning and time series analysis to forecast future stock prices. The model is developed using the Random Forest algorithm and is designed to help investors and financial analysts make informed decisions based on historical stock data.

## Features

- **Machine Learning with Random Forest**: The model employs the Random Forest algorithm to predict stock prices, refining predictions for higher accuracy.
- **Time Series Analysis**: The project incorporates time series analysis to capture trends and patterns in stock prices over time.
- **Historical Data Import**: The model imports historical stock data using the `yFinance` library, providing a robust dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations are created using `Pandas` and other Python libraries to provide clear insights into stock price trends and patterns.
- **Prediction Refinement**: The model is iteratively refined to enhance prediction accuracy, ensuring reliable forecasts for future stock prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `yfinance`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-price-prediction-model
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries and load the historical stock data using `yFinance`.
2. Preprocess the data and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the trends.
3. Train the Random Forest model on the historical data.
4. Use the model to predict future stock prices and visualize the predictions.
